# Space_Garden
The Game Project I worked on in my second Semester at the School for Games.


Space Garden is supposed to be a calm and relaxing buildup Game with certain Rescourcemanagement elements.

Due to massive overscoping and misscalculating the Time needed for tasks by my team and me, it never fully Finished in Time which tought a good lesson for getting to know my Limits better.
